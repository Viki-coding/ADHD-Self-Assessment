<h1> Introduction </h1>
This program is an ADHD assessment tool for adults.  

ADHD/ADD Attention Deficit (Hyper) Disorder is a neurodiverse challenge that affects many people.  Many adults don't even realise they have ADHD, many don't reach their full potential due to ADHD.  

In Ireland today, a formal diagnosis is only done through an Educational Psychologist or Psychiatrist. The first step when someone is stuggling is to go to visit their GP.  GP's are not all fully up to speed on how difficult is can be to have ADHD and may not fully be aware of the correct questions to ask to be able to refer their patient to correct health professional. 

There is a misconception that many people who were lazy in school, acted up due to boredom, lacked concentration was becuase they were bold but data shows that many have ADHD and if diagnosed correctly with and correct mangement can lead very full and productive lives.  People with ADHD have 'super-powers' that lead them to be able to hyper-focus on very complex issues, many are highly intelligent but may not have gotten good grades on subjects that bored them but excelled in subjects that did. 

<h2>Description - Project Purpose - Content </h2>

"Research suggests that the symptoms of ADHD can persist into adulthood, having a significant impact on the relationships, careers, and even the personal safety of patients who may suffer from it. Because this disorder is often misunderstood, many people who have it do not receive appropriate treatment and, as a result, may never reach their full potential. Part of the problem is that it can be difficult to diagnose, particularly in adults." ADD.org 

The user is asked 6 questions with options.  These 5 options remain the same, creating a clear and concise user required response which createes a familiar user interactive experince to elicit a postive user experience.  The questions and content are laid out logically and clearly allowing ituitve interaction while giveing user feedback.  It is clear to see which question is being displayed and the users reponse is displayed under that question. Each response is scored and the result is displayed as a score with some advice to the user.  The results indicate if the user has/has not symptoms that may indicate they have ADHD. The content reflects the 6 most indicative questions as referenced in XXXX and the responses clarifies the purpose It is not a formal diagnosis. 

The program aims to allow people/GP's to check if they have some symptoms that may indicate they have ADHD, they can then decide wheather they wish to look into having a formal diagnosis.  

ADHD is heriditary.  A diagnois can help families discover issues they many have been experiencing to be able to gain the correct support and help.  

<h2>User Demographics - Target audience</h2>
The target auidence for this tool is people over 17 years of age.  GP's can use this tool to assess if they feel their patient may have ADHD so they can refer them for a more comprehensive diagnosis. The benefit of this tool to be able to get more informed about this condiation and make positive changes to peoples lives.  

Unfortunetly in Ireland the waiting lists for educational pychologists and psychiarists is very long and can be very expensive. To be able to use an on-line tool to rule ADHD in OR out for a patient is hugely important and benefical to both the patient but also the over-burdoned healthcare system. 

<h2>UX</h2>

<h2>USER STORIES / GOALS </h2>
As a [user], I want to [perform some task] so that I can [achieve some goal]
As a GP user I want to log in easily and be able to see the questions I need to ask my patients.
As a GP user I need a relatively quick assessment tool to ascertain whether or not my patient may or may not have ADHD. 
As a GP user I want to see the users score to give me an idea if they just have mild symptoms or more significant and recurring symptoms. 
As a  GP user I want to be able to make informed decisions so I can help my patient be referred to the correct healthcare professional.

<h2>Future Implementation Section</h2>

 - Include more questions to develop the questionaire to be a more accurate assessment tool
 - Develop other healthcare question checks such as Peri-menopause menopause tools to allow women to assess their symptoms in the security of their own home, allowing them to be more informed to be able to make the next decision into their own health managment.
 - Sexually Transmitted Disease checker - different sympthoms pertain to different STD's, ofthen embarrising - allow users to assess what they may have while educating them about STDs and informing them of the next steps they need to take.

BUGS RESOLVED AND NOTE SOLUTIONS AND UNRESOLVED
	
We performed manual testing on the deployed site and also ran our html, css and js codes through validators.
<h3>W3C Validator</h3>
<h3> CSS (Jigsaw) validator</h3>
<h2>JavaScript Code Validator</h2>
<h2> JSON formatter and Validator</h2>

<h2>Quality Assurance</h2>
 (Steps taken to manually test the project
-	Ensures it functions correctly
-	Identifies potential bugs
User Experience Assurance
-	Ensures that the end-users have a smooth experience by addressing potential issues. 
We took a systematic and structural approach to manually test each page to ensure it functions correctly and to help identify potential bugs. We created a specific testing template to ensure and re-check all aspects of the quiz were working correctly as specified with expected and actual outcomes using a methodical approach. We did final testing on the deployed site. 

<h3>Test Evaluation Sheet:</h3>
● Testing: Validation of Python, Bugs, Input testing, User Stories, (Optional: Automated Testing)

As shown in the evaluation sheet below we navigated around our site and tested all available features to ensure they were working as intended.

<h2>Lighthouse Testing</h2>
<h2>BUGS</h2>
<u>Solved Bugs</u>
I came across many bugs while testing the quiz, from missing semi-colons to indenting incorrectly.  Using the python code checker while writing the code helped to higlight these.  It was also helpful breaking down the problem and  thinking logically - what’s working, what’s not to be able to focus in on the issue. 

While doing some testing I had been quickly entering name or letters without using an uppercase for the first name, so during a systematic check when I did capitalise my first name the following error was displayed.  On looking at my code I discovered I used .upper() method rather than .lower() Once amended it worked. 
<img width="475" alt="Capital V not being accepted" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/507826cf-1200-4224-ae3f-4647ff561ae1">


<img width="576" alt="incorrect  upper for response" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3ae5859f-9d31-4e50-9e00-b7bcf0226610">

<img width="528" alt="Repeating response bug" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c9498de7-f850-4c61-a444-e2689d3441e0">
Unlike other quizes where there are a few options to choose from I just wanted to display the same survey/questionaire responses. I amended the correct iteration variable and it now works well. 

<img width="545" alt="Results showing incorrect score due to wrong to from scores" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ba33d17c-2a87-4a99-b1ff-a8a3f31bbcd8">
On testing I entered 'e' on all my responses which should of displayed the print message that I had a high likelhood of having ADHD when in fact it displayed to me that I had 'mild' symtoms.  When looking at my code I had only used >= to scores rather than a range.  Once I fixed this it worked correctly.

<img width="1034" alt="all questions and answers displayed" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/913b3d1c-fec2-4d0c-824f-14ce5144a907">
I did not iterate through my questions and options correctly and just got dumped all the questions at once.  After watching many a youtube video I finally figured it out and it worked correctly.

<b>Videos & Websites that we gained visual clues of how to create the Quiz:</b>

We gained inspiration with the READ.me by watching the video 'Creating your README with Kasia Boguckae' on slack and Community Q&A, Lucy Rush the Assessments Lead chats to our own Lane-Sawyer Thompson to answers some frequently asked questions surrounding Portfolio Project 3. Thanks to the on-line tutors for their expertise and ability to explain some challenges I encountered. Thanks to our very supportive and positive facilitator Kay and my Kiwi mentor Dick Vlaanderen. Also found the webinar 'Community Q&A: How to Troubleshoot with Lane-Sawyer Thompson' very helpful approach to how to view looking at the site for bugs and methodically identifying issues.


<h2>CONTENT</h2>
[The content for the quiz is from the ADD.org the Attention Deficit Disorder association of America ](https://add.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/adhd-questionnaire-ASRS111.pdf)

[This questionaire is used accross America and Canada and the World Health Organisation.] (https://add.org/adhd-questionnaire/)

This program is not an accurage diagnostic tool.  In this educational coding project I have only used the first 6 questions on the questionaire which can tell the patient has sympthoms that are highly consistent with ADHD and require further investigation. In the full questionire it is advised to answer a further 12 questions, but I felt that was too many for this particular project. 

<h2>Legal & Ethical Compliance</h2>
This project is for educational purposes only.
