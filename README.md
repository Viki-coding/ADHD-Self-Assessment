<h1> Introduction </h1>

This program is an ADHD assessment tool for adults.  


> **What is ADHD:** [From ADHD Ireland] 
"ADHD – Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder is a medical/neurobiological condition in which the brain’s neurotransmitter chemicals; noradrenalin and dopamine do not work properly. <b>It is a disorder that, without proper identification, treatment and management, can have serious and long-lasting consequences and/or complications for an individual.  </b> It is a genetic and long-term condition which affects learning and behaviour right through the school years and in many cases beyond into adulthood.  ADHD is a disorder that can co-exist to a greater or lesser degree, with any or other disorders such as dyslexia, autism, learning disorder, dyspraxia, conduct disorder, oppositional defiance disorder.  <b>It is important to note that ADHD is a very treatable condition. If diagnosed and properly treated, people with ADHD can reach their potential and lead happy and successful lives."</b>

In Ireland today, a formal diagnosis is only done through an Educational Psychologist or Psychiatrist. The first step when someone is stuggling is to go to visit their GP.  GP's are not all fully up to speed on how difficult is can be to have ADHD and may not fully be aware of the correct questions to ask to be able to refer their patient to correct health professional. 

There is a misconception that many people who were lazy in school, acted up due to boredom, lacked concentration was becuase they were bold but data shows that many have ADHD and if diagnosed correctly with and correct mangement can lead very full and productive lives.  People with ADHD have 'super-powers' that lead them to be able to hyper-focus on very complex issues, many are highly intelligent but may not have gotten good grades on subjects that bored them but excelled in subjects that did. 

<h2>Description - Project Purpose - Content </h2>

The main problem many adults have is not being diagnosed.  Many adults who have ADHD have struggled for years not even knowing what ADHD is.  By equiping individuals and GPs with more information about ADHD and signs to look out for will allow them to get on the path for formal disagnosis and treatment, leading to improved outcomes. 

>  [From ADD.org ] "Research suggests that the symptoms of ADHD can persist into adulthood, having a significant impact on the relationships, careers, and even the personal safety of patients who may suffer from it. Because this disorder is often misunderstood, many people who have it do not receive appropriate treatment and, as a result, may never reach their full potential. Part of the problem is that it can be difficult to diagnose, particularly in adults." 


Using this tool we want adults to gain easy access to a diagnosis individually or through their GP. Diagnosis is done through a series of questions. 

<b>Scoring</b>
The user is asked 6 questions with the following options:

  - A. Never 
  - B. Rarely
  - C. Sometimes
  - D. Often
  - E. Very Often
   
     These 5 options (a, b, c, d & e) remain the same, creating a clear and concise user required response which createes a familiar user interactive experince to elicit a postive user experience.  The questions and content are laid out logically and clearly allow ituitve interaction while giveing user feedback.  It is clear to see which question is being displayed and the users reponse is displayed under that question. Each response is scored, at the end of the questionaire all scores are added up and the result is displayed as a score with some advice to the user.  The results indicate if the user has/has not symptoms that may indicate they have ADHD. The question content reflects the 6 most indicative questions as referenced in Attention Deficit Disorder Association of America assessment tool in conjuction with the World Health Organisation (referenced in credits below).
     
     Scoring system:

     a = 0

     b = 0

     c = 1

     d = 2

     e = 3

Scoring Range: 

     - If a user scores between 0-3 they show no signs of ADHD
     - If a user scores between 4-6 they show mild signs of ADHD
     - If a user scores between 7-12 they show signs of ADHD
     - If a user score between 13-18 they show very strong signs of ADHD
    
    IT IS NOT A FORMAL DIAGNOSIS. 

The program aims to allow people/GP's to check if they have some symptoms that may indicate they have ADHD, they can then decide wheather they wish to look into having a formal diagnosis.  

ADHD is heriditary.  A diagnois can help families discover issues they many have been experiencing to be able to gain the correct support and help.  

<h2>User Demographics - Target audience</h2>
The target auidence for this tool is people over 17 years of age.  GP's can use this tool to assess if they feel their patient may have ADHD so they can refer them for a more comprehensive diagnosis. The benefit of this tool to be able to get more informed about this condiation and make positive changes to peoples lives.  

Unfortunetly in Ireland the waiting lists for educational pychologists and psychiarists is very long and can be very expensive. To be able to use an on-line tool to rule ADHD in OR out for a patient is hugely important and benefical to both the patient but also the over-burdoned healthcare system. 

<h2>UX</h2>

<h2>User Stories / Goals: </h2>

 - As a GP user I want to log in easily and be able to see the questions I need to ask my patients.
 - As a GP user I need a relatively quick assessment tool to ascertain whether or not my patient may or may not have ADHD. 
 -   As a GP user I want to see the users score to give me an idea if they just have mild symptoms or more significant and recurring symptoms. 
 - As a  GP user I want to be able to make informed decisions so I can help my patient be referred to the correct healthcare professional. 
 - As a user at home, I want to assess if I may have ADHD as I find it hard to contentrate and finish tasks and feel that if I know I may have it I can seek approatote healthcare advice. 
 - As a parent at home, I think my teenage son may have ADHD, the waiting list for assessment is very long, I would like a quick and straight forward test to assess if he may have it before he sits his state exams so that we can help get access to the most appriatote treatment and services. 

<h2>Design Choices</h2>

At the start of our project we created a Flowchart.  The flowchart shows the flow of the program and indicates the decisions the user needs to make in order to take them to the next step.  The flowchart indicates the loops used to manage error handlings such as invalid value inputs. 

The use of lines in the program helps to distinguish the beginning of the programe, between the various quesions and also distinguished the results section at the end of the page.

<h2>Future Implementation Section</h2>

 - Include more questions to develop the questionaire to be a more accurate assessment tool
 - Develop other healthcare question checks such as Peri-menopause menopause tools to allow women to assess their symptoms in the security of their own home, allowing them to be more informed to be able to make the next decision into their own health managment.
 - Sexually Transmitted Disease checker - different sympthoms pertain to different STD's, ofthen embarrising - allow users to assess what they may have while educating them about STDs and informing them of the next steps they need to take.

<h2>BUGS</h2>
<u>Solved Bugs</u>
I came across many bugs while testing the quiz, from missing semi-colons to indenting incorrectly.  Using the python code checker while writing the code helped to higlight these.  It was also helpful breaking down the problem and  thinking logically - what’s working, what’s not to be able to focus in on the issue. 

While doing some testing I had been quickly entering name or letters without using an uppercase for the first name, so during a systematic check when I did capitalise my first name the following error was displayed.  On looking at my code I discovered I used .upper() method rather than .lower() Once amended it worked. 
<img width="475" alt="Capital V not being accepted" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/507826cf-1200-4224-ae3f-4647ff561ae1">


<img width="576" alt="incorrect  upper for response" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3ae5859f-9d31-4e50-9e00-b7bcf0226610">

<img width="528" alt="Repeating response bug" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c9498de7-f850-4c61-a444-e2689d3441e0">
Unlike other quizes where there are a few options to choose from I just wanted to display the same survey/questionaire responses. I amended the correct iteration variable and it now works well. 

<img width="545" alt="Results showing incorrect score due to wrong to from scores" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ba33d17c-2a87-4a99-b1ff-a8a3f31bbcd8">
On testing I entered 'e' on all my responses which should of displayed the print message that I had a high likelhood of having ADHD when in fact it displayed to me that I had 'mild' symtoms.  When looking at my code I had only used >= to scores rather than a range.  Once I fixed this it worked correctly.

<img width="1034" alt="all questions and answers displayed" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/913b3d1c-fec2-4d0c-824f-14ce5144a907">
I did not iterate through my questions and options correctly and just got dumped all the questions at once.  After watching many a youtube video I finally figured it out and it worked correctly.

Thanks to the on-line tutors for their expertise and ability to explain some challenges I encountered. Thanks to our very supportive and positive facilitator Kay and my Kiwi mentor Dick Vlaanderen. 



<h2>CONTENT</h2>
The content for the quiz is from the [ADD.org] the Attention Deficit Disorder association of America [Link] (https://add.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/adhd-questionnaire-ASRS111.pdf)

This questionaire is used accross America and Canada and the World Health Organisation. [Link] (https://add.org/adhd-questionnaire/)

Definition of ADHD  [From ADHD Ireland] (https://adhdireland.ie/general-information/what-is-adhd/) for introduction text. 

This program is not an accurage diagnostic tool.  In this educational coding project I have only used the first 6 questions on the questionaire which can tell the patient has sympthoms that are highly consistent with ADHD and require further investigation. In the full questionire it is advised to answer a further 12 questions, but I felt that was too many for this particular project. 

<h2>Legal & Ethical Compliance</h2>
This project is for educational coding purposes only. It is not a formal diagnositic tool for ADHD. This information also displayed on welcome screen when project first lauches.
